# Data-Warehousing

This is the academic project for Data Warehousing Exam. This features a BIKE MS dataset which has around 5 tables.
BIKE MS is about donation to raise funds and awareness against a disease which is called Multiple Sclerosis which is found in North Europe and North America.
The goal of this project is to analyse the amount of donation given by teams and participants based on name ,division and prior participant. I analysed and retrieved also  donors  based on countries,gender and type of donations over years(2013-2017).
It was to be concluded using Spark, Hive, Postgres and for visualization, I have used Tableau.
